		{"name": "Government", "default": true, "desc": "Public Bills deal with matters of public policy. Most are introduced to Parliament by the Government.

		{"name": "HoL Private", "default": false, "desc": "Private Members' Bills are Public Bills introduced by MPs and Lords who are not government ministers. As with other Public Bills their purpose is to change the law as it applies to the general population.

		{"name": "Presentation", "default": false, "desc": "A Presentation Bill allows any MP to give notice of his or her intention to present a Bill on any future day. Notice must be in writing and must include the short and long titles. Presentation takes place at the time of Preliminary Business. The MP should be standing behind the Speaker's Chair on the Government side until called by the Speaker."}
